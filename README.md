# Project Artemis Waiter
Placing orders in restaurants can be an issue sometimes when waitstaff resources are limited. This often causes misplaced orders and long waiting times. Splitting the bills often also causes confusion or delays in the restaurant.

Artemis is available here to solve this problem. Our mobile platform provides features such as table reservations, ordering, reviewing, split bills, and Augmented Reality. Artemis aims to increase the efficiency of the workflow in the restaurant by providing convenience both for customers and waitstaff, resulting in increased productivity.

Built as part of the course COMP3900 - Computer Science Project.
