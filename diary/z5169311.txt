Week 1

I was absent during week 1, but was aware to form group of 5 and was briefd what we will do. 
I participated in the brainstorming online as I wasn't able to attend physically.

Week 2
Decided to choose the waiter app. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements and the user stories. I had to add the stories into Jira.
We also discussed the architecture of the software (database, api, frameworks, etc). 
I was given the backend part of the software, mainly REST APIs. Started to impement very basic order

Week 3

Worked on the proposal as each member was assigned different parts. 
I was in charge of the software architecture with Ganang.
Made the order REST API endpoints. 
Schema changes means that I needed to change bits of the API


Week 4
Completed the order APIs. Moved on to the status of the order. 
Fixed the schema so it fits more on the document base MongoDB.
Instead of having references to another collection, we embed it all in one document so it's easier to fetch.

Week 5
Made the session schema in order to store the user's table id and order
and order item so that it can track the current session and how long they stay
in the restaurant

Week 6
Start to look into the Google Dialogflow api for the chatbot.
Made modification to the back end (Session)

Week 7
Implemented the chatbot using Dialogflow's API. This involves training the bot
for intents and conversation that can retrieve the information about the restaurant
menus, review, abouts, etc.

Week 8
This week, cleaned up the code, deleted some unused code and added some
error exception catching to make it easier for debug

Week 9
This week fixed the chatbot and used the dialogflow messenger in the react app and made more functionality
with the bot (ask for recommendation, show the reviews, show images). Implemented the food review,
email reservation, and some bug fixes before the presentation.

Week 10
Presentation Demo week. Fixed minor bugs, started on the report for the final submission
